_Hi there! I am Hassan Anwar, an enthusiastic Software Engineer. Iâ€™ve been in the exciting domain of the coding for over 6 years, now. During this tenure, I have worked with several startups and larger co- operations. Working on different in-house and client-based projects helped me to broaden my vision about technology and development. Along this exciting journey, I realized my passion to create and develop new opportunities in this vast domain of computer science. To concrete my passion, I have now launched a startup, named as WeTeck. We welcome you to share your ideas and Wetech will help you to develop a new reality of innovative technology based on your idea/dream._
